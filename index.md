## Featured Projects

### Self-Balancing Roller Robot
- Designed and built a self-balancing robot powered by an IMU and ESP32 microcontroller  
- Tuned a PID controller to maintain zero-tilt, coordinating and characterizing 3 DC motors with IMU feedback  
- Stress-tested and fault-analyzed the system for robustness, achieving a design highly resistant to tipping
